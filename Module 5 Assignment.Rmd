### This dataset is a simulated data set containing information on ten thousand customers. The aim here is to predict which customers will default on their credit card debt.
### Source: http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ISLR/Default.html


df <- read.csv(file = "C:\\Users\\cg\\Desktop\\Echo\\School\\DSC503\\Module 5\\default.csv")
```

```{r Variables}
### The "default" variable is a factor indicating whether the customer defaulted on their debt.
### The "student" variable is a factor indicating whether the customer is a student.
### The "balance" variable is the average balance that the customer has remaining on their credit card after making their monthly payment.
### The "income"  variable is the income of the customer .
```

```{r Perform Summary Analysis}
head(df)

summary(df)
```

```{r Update "default" values}
### We need to convert no/yes values into 0/1.

df$default_binary <- 0
df[df$default == 'Yes',]$default_binary <- 1
```

```{r Perform Summary Analysis #2}
### Perform another summary analysis with this new column included.
head(df)

summary(df)
```

```{r Perform Logistic Regression Analysis}
logistic <- glm(default_binary~student+balance+income, data=df, family=binomial(link='logit'))

summary(logistic)
```

```{r Perform Logistic Regression Analysis #2}
### I removed the income variables from analysis because its p value shows it's not important to the outcome I will rerun my analysis without this variable.

logistic2 <- glm(default_binary ~ balance + student, data=df, family=binomial(link='logit'))

summary(logistic2)
```

```{r Identify the Coefficients}
### The coefficient of the intercept is -1.075e+01 (or -10.75)
### The coefficient of the balance is 5.738e-03 (or 0.005738)
### The coefficient of the studentYes is -7.149e-01 (or -0.7149)
### The coefficients are in a form called "logits"
```

```{r Convert logits/coefficients to Odds then to Probability}

### To convert the coefficients into probabilities, we first take the coefficients of the GLM output and use exp() to "de-logarithimize" and get odds.
odds <- exp(coef(logistic2))
odds

### Then we Convert Odds to probbaility with the formula Probability = Odds/(1+Odds)
probability <- odds/(1+odds)
probability
```

```{r Predict Default based on Student Status}

### If not StudentYes, then the Log Odds would be > Default = -10.75 + -0.7149(0)
StudentYes0 <- -10.75
StudentYes0

### If StudentYes, then the Log Odds would be > Default = -10.75 + -0.7149(1)
StudentYes1 <- -10.75 - 0.7149
StudentYes1

### StudentYes0 is the log(odds) of a non-student customer defaulting on their credit card. StudentYes1 indicates the decrease in the log(odds) that a student customer would default on their credit card. In other words, StudentYes1 is the log(odds ratio) of the odds that a student customer would default on their credit card, over the odds that a non student customer would default on their credit card. 

OddsRatio_Student <- StudentYes1/StudentYes0
OddsRatio_Student

### The StudentYes variable as an odd ratio of 1.07, meaning the odds of defaulting increases by 7% for student customers.
```

```{r Predict Default based on Balance amount}

### If Balance is equal to zero, then the LogOdds would be > Default = -10.75 + 0.005738(0)
Balance0 <- -10.75
Balance0

### If Balance is equal to one, then the LogOdds would be > Default = -10.75 + 0.005738(1)
Balance1 <- -10.75 + 0.005738
Balance1

### Following a similar process as above we would get the odds ratio of the balance variable with the following code:

OddsRatio_Balance <- Balance0/Balance1
OddsRatio_Balance

### This ratio means that for each unit (dollar) that the balance variable increases, the odds of defaulting rises by .05%
```

```{r Graph Logistic with Balance}
### Plotting a logistic regression graph using balance on the X axis.

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(
  data=logistic2, 
  aes(x=balance, y=default_binary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"), se=TRUE, fullrange = TRUE)
```
